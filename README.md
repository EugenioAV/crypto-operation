# crypto-operation
Python interface for encrypt/decrypt messages

### Requirements
* rsa == 4.0
```
pip install rsa
```

Python-RSA is a pure-Python RSA implementation. It supports encryption and decryption, signing and verifying signatures, and key generation.

You can start the application with this command:
```python
python main.py
```

There are public/private keys in this project for testing purposes, but you can also generate your own keys:
```python
python create_keys.py
```
